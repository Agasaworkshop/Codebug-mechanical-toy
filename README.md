# Codebug-mechanical-toy
This is a mechanical toy I've made, it is designed after a codebug, the mascot of a Vtuber called Ellie Minibot.  
It's quite finicky and it requires quite a lot of time to assemble.  
This project was made by [Agasa's workshop](https://www.youtube.com/@agasa_workshop) I will probably made a video about the designing but I suck at making videos. 

# Other than a printer it will also require: 
- soldering iron for heated inserts
- some kind of grinding tool and a tool for cutting threaded rod (I used a dremel)
- something to cut paper clips
- also wear eye protection gear (and do not grind metal in your bedroom).

# Other than filament this will require:
- Black paint
- green paint
- sewing thread (around 1mm diameter, it must be soft)
- Paper clips
- 15mm section of M4 threaded rod x 4 
- 15mm section of M8 threaded rod x 1 
- Heated inserts x 10
- M3x6 screws x 12(M3x8 or M3x10 are also fine)
- M3x31mm threaded rod (or cut a screw) 

# Assembly
Here is a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17TNqPtdITjP4wfICJyDFUxXSGkCXKZ_BBH0YAckLzc4/edit?usp=sharing) with all the parts listed with suggested printing settings (all supports should be "touching buildplate only").
The spreadsheet also indicates the Hex colors of each part in the images.
- Predrill all the holes indicated in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17TNqPtdITjP4wfICJyDFUxXSGkCXKZ_BBH0YAckLzc4/edit?usp=sharing) (it's done this way to ensure either an accurate fit or avoid too narrow walls).  
- Add 6 heated inserts to the base_top and 4 to the base_bottom  
- For the Counterweights: you should cut a 20cm piece of thread, make a double knot on one end and pass it through the circular hole above the D-shaft cutout in the counterweights, then mount the counterweight to a axle or leg while keeping the string in his place so that once the counterweight is in the string can't be pulled out due to the knot.  
- For the base: you should screw the feet to the base_top (you should thread them with a M3 screw)  
- For shafts and small gears: you should add a piece of paperclip in the dedicated hole after aligning it (for a better fit, bend the paper clips forward and then backward when inserting them. This ensures they have a bit more friction)
- For the strings: you should remove the cams from the shaft, then pass all the strings through the closest hole in the base and arrange them from the bottom so that they do not overlap, then mount them to the screw holes with the wire_stops, ensure that they are tensioned enough to not nove the counterweights up but almost do it.
- For the cams: you should first mark where the strings pass beneath the shaft (with a marker) and take note of which string moves which arm, then add the lower_arm_cam2 to the bottom 2 right arms(from the front), then add the lower_arm_cam 1 to the bottom 2 left arms and the upper_arm_cam to the top left one.     

Here are the images that display the position of each component, there are also .blend files (blender) that have all the parts correctly named and positioned, the colors are listed in the spreadsheet:
